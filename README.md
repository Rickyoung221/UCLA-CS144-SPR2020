## Course Description
### Project Overview
Your project is to build an online Web site that allows users to post blog entries written in markdown. Over the quarter, your will need to implement the Web site twice, once using a more “traditional” stack based on MySQL and Apache Tomcat, and once more using a “modern” stack based on MongoDB, Node.js, Express, and Angular (a.k.a. MEAN stack). Through this project, you will get familiar with the following software tools:

Docker
MySQL
Apache Tomcat
MongoDB
Node.js
Express
Angular
Locust
Apache Spark
In addition to the above software tools, you will gain experience with Servlet programming in Java, and building Web applications using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

The project should be done either individually or by a team of two students.

Part 1: System Setup and Warm-up
In this part, you will have to set up a provided “container” on your computer and interact with MySQL to populate data and query them. You will also have to implement a simple Java program to brush up on Java programming.

Part 2: Markdown Editor on Tomcat
In this part, you will need to implement a simple online markdown editor using MySQL and Tomcat.

Part 3: Blogging Server Using MongoDB and NodeJS
Now you will will have to implement a Blogging server using the MEAN stack. In this part, you write the server-side program that saves and publishes blog posts written by the markdown-editor client that will be built in Part 4. The server-side program will be developed using MongoDB, NodeJS, and Express.

Part 4: Markdown Editor Using Angular
In this part, you will use an advanced version of the markdown editor client using Angular. All entries saved by the editor will be stored in the server implemented as part of Part 3.

Part 5: Performance and Scalability
In the last part of our project, you will explore issues of performance and scalability of Web applications.
